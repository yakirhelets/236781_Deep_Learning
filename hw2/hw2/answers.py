part2_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**
1. In the graph, we can see that the accuracy with dropout=0.4 is greater than dropout=0, and dropout=0 is greater than dropout=0.8.
The results are matching our expectations since some dropout improves the generalization of the model (i.e less likely to overfit).
In our case, the training set is relatively small in comparison to the test set, thus more likely to overfit. Therefore we can see
in the results that no dropout produce lesser results than some dropout (dropout=0.4).

2. We can see that low-dropout settings produce much higher results than high-dropout settings. In fact, the high-dropout setting
shows lesser results than no-dropout settings. The explanation for this is that too much dropout (in our case we're dropping 80% of the neurons),
hinders the learning process.
